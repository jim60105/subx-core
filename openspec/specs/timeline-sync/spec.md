# Timeline Sync

## Purpose

Define the core sync machinery: the two sync methods and their engine-side selection, offset clamping, subtitle timing application, VAD audio processing and detector behavior, first-sentence offset annotation, VAD padding configuration, manual-offset application, the core-owned pairing resolution and default output path derivation, and the sync command's structured JSON payload — implemented in `src/core/sync/` and `src/core/audio/` (per the archived requirements' own path citations). The `subx-cli` repository carries the same-named `timeline-sync` capability holding the CLI halves: the `sync` argument structs as thin adapters, batch pairing heuristics, single-file mode framing, and CLI VAD parameter overrides.
## Requirements

### Requirement: Sync Method Selection

The system SHALL support two sync methods selected by the caller: `vad` (local Voice Activity Detection) and `manual` (user-supplied offset). When the caller declares no method, the engine SHALL fall back to the method declared by `sync.default_method` in configuration. The `--method` flag and the validation that manual mode carries an explicit `--offset` are `subx-cli`'s, specified by the `timeline-sync` capability's *Sync Argument Struct Is a Thin Adapter Over Core Pairing* requirement in `subx-cli`.

`SyncEngine`'s VAD precondition SHALL apply to engine construction only, and SHALL NOT be the gate on the manual-offset transform:

- `SyncEngine::new` SHALL retain its current signature and its current behaviour, including the unconditional VAD requirement. Relaxing it is a separate change with the command surface on the other side of it.
- A caller that needs only the manual-offset transform SHALL use `shift_subtitle_timing` (see *VAD-Independent Manual Offset Application*) rather than constructing an engine, and SHALL NOT reimplement the transform.
- `SyncEngine::new`'s rustdoc SHALL state that the VAD requirement is unconditional and SHALL name the free function as the entry point for manual-offset-only callers.

#### Scenario: VAD detector is required unconditionally
- **GIVEN** VAD is disabled in configuration or the VAD detector fails to initialize
- **WHEN** `SyncEngine::new` is called
- **THEN** engine construction SHALL unconditionally return a configuration error stating that the VAD detector is required but unavailable, regardless of which sync method the user ultimately selects

#### Scenario: The construction precondition does not reach the manual transform
- **GIVEN** the same configuration on which `SyncEngine::new` returns the configuration error above
- **WHEN** a manual offset is applied through `shift_subtitle_timing`
- **THEN** the transform SHALL succeed, and no caller SHALL be required to duplicate the transform in order to reach it

### Requirement: Offset Clamping Against Maximum

The system SHALL enforce `sync.max_offset_seconds`: manual offsets exceeding this absolute value SHALL be rejected with an error, and VAD-detected offsets exceeding it SHALL be clamped (preserving sign) and accompanied by a warning in the sync result.

The guard's location is normative, because the transform it guards is reachable independently:

- The manual-offset guard SHALL live on `SyncEngine::apply_manual_offset`, which reads `self.config.max_offset_seconds` and returns the configuration error before any entry is modified.
- The guard SHALL NOT be moved into `shift_subtitle_timing`. That function is specified as unguarded (*VAD-Independent Manual Offset Application*) so that a host which validates the offset against its own presentation of `sync.max_offset_seconds` — for example in whole milliseconds, to keep its own pre-check and the library's check on the same side of a rounding boundary — is not subjected to a second, differently-rounded check.
- A caller reaching the transform directly SHALL be responsible for its own bound. This division SHALL be stated in both items' rustdoc.

#### Scenario: Manual offset exceeds maximum
- **GIVEN** `sync.max_offset_seconds = 60` and the user supplies `--offset 120`
- **WHEN** `apply_manual_offset` runs
- **THEN** the call SHALL return a configuration error referencing `sync.max_offset_seconds` and the subtitle entries SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: VAD offset clamping
- **GIVEN** `sync.max_offset_seconds = 30` and VAD detects an offset of 45s
- **WHEN** `vad_detect_sync_offset` returns
- **THEN** the resulting `SyncResult.offset_seconds` SHALL equal 30 (sign preserved), `SyncResult.warnings` SHALL contain a message explaining the clamping, and `additional_info` SHALL record the original and clamped values

#### Scenario: The guard is not duplicated into the free function
- **GIVEN** a proposal to add the `sync.max_offset_seconds` check to `shift_subtitle_timing`
- **WHEN** it is evaluated against this requirement
- **THEN** it SHALL be rejected, because the free function has no `SyncConfig` and adding one would restore the construction-time configuration dependency the function exists to avoid

### Requirement: Subtitle Timing Application

The system SHALL shift every subtitle entry's start and end time by the applied offset, clamping negative results to zero rather than producing negative timestamps.

The transform SHALL have exactly one implementation:

- The shift SHALL be implemented once, in `shift_subtitle_timing` (`src/core/sync/mod.rs`). A positive offset SHALL use a checked addition and SHALL return an audio-processing error if any entry's time would overflow; a negative offset SHALL saturate at `Duration::ZERO` rather than erroring.
- The returned `SyncResult` SHALL carry `offset_seconds` as supplied, `confidence = 1.0`, `method_used = SyncMethod::Manual`, `correlation_peak = 1.0`, an `additional_info` object recording the applied offset and the number of entries modified, and the measured processing duration.
- `SyncEngine::apply_manual_offset` SHALL obtain both the shift and the `SyncResult` from that function and SHALL NOT construct either itself.

#### Scenario: Positive offset delays subtitles
- **GIVEN** a subtitle entry with `start_time = 10s` and the engine applies a +2.5s offset
- **WHEN** `apply_manual_offset` runs
- **THEN** the entry's new `start_time` SHALL be 12.5s

#### Scenario: Negative offset clamps to zero
- **GIVEN** a subtitle entry with `start_time = 1s` and the engine applies a -5s offset within the maximum
- **WHEN** `apply_manual_offset` runs
- **THEN** the entry's new `start_time` SHALL be `Duration::ZERO` rather than a negative value

#### Scenario: Positive offset beyond the representable range is rejected
- **GIVEN** a subtitle entry whose `end_time` is `Duration::MAX` and a positive offset within `sync.max_offset_seconds`
- **WHEN** the shift is applied through either entry point
- **THEN** an audio-processing error SHALL be returned rather than a wrapped or truncated timestamp

### Requirement: VAD Audio Processing

The system SHALL provide `VadAudioProcessor` that loads an audio or video file, downmixes multi-channel audio to mono, preserves the file's original sample rate in the returned `AudioInfo`, and converts f32 PCM samples to i16. An invalid or non-existent path SHALL return an error rather than panic. Implemented in `src/services/vad/` and exercised by `tests/vad_audio_processor_tests.rs` and `tests/vad_integration_tests.rs`.

#### Scenario: Multi-channel input downmixed and sample rate preserved
- **GIVEN** a WAV input with sample rate 44100 Hz and two channels
- **WHEN** `VadAudioProcessor::load_and_prepare_audio_direct` processes it
- **THEN** the returned `AudioData.info.sample_rate` SHALL equal 44100 and `AudioData.info.channels` SHALL equal 1

#### Scenario: Float32 PCM converted to i16
- **GIVEN** a WAV file with one f32 sample equal to `0.5`
- **WHEN** the processor loads and prepares the file
- **THEN** the returned `samples[0]` SHALL be an `i16` value within 10 of `i16::MAX / 2`

#### Scenario: Non-existent audio path errors
- **GIVEN** a path that does not exist
- **WHEN** `load_and_prepare_audio_direct` is called
- **THEN** the call SHALL return an error rather than panic

### Requirement: VAD Detector Behavior

`LocalVadDetector` SHALL detect speech segments whose `start_time < end_time` and whose durations are bounded below by the configured `min_speech_duration_ms`; higher `sensitivity` SHALL produce at least as many segments as lower sensitivity on the same input. `VadSyncDetector::detect_sync_offset` SHALL return an error when the provided subtitle has no entries, and SHALL return `SyncMethod::LocalVad` as the method used.

#### Scenario: Sensitivity monotonicity
- **GIVEN** the same audio input processed by two detectors configured with `sensitivity = 0.1` and `sensitivity = 0.9`
- **WHEN** both detectors run
- **THEN** the segment count at low sensitivity SHALL be less than or equal to the segment count at high sensitivity (tolerating a difference of at most 1)

#### Scenario: Empty subtitle rejected
- **GIVEN** a subtitle with zero entries
- **WHEN** `VadSyncDetector::detect_sync_offset` is awaited
- **THEN** it SHALL return an error whose message contains `No subtitle entries found`

### Requirement: First-Sentence Offset Annotation

When VAD-assisted sync computes an offset by aligning the first detected speech segment with the first subtitle entry, the resulting `SyncResult` SHALL populate `additional_info` with both `first_speech_start` and `expected_subtitle_start`, such that `offset_seconds == first_speech_start - expected_subtitle_start` (within a small tolerance). Exercised by `tests/sync_first_sentence_offset_integration_tests.rs`.

#### Scenario: Offset equals first-speech minus expected-start
- **GIVEN** a real audio+subtitle asset pair and a VAD-enabled `SyncEngine`
- **WHEN** `detect_sync_offset(..., Some(SyncMethod::Auto))` returns a result
- **THEN** `additional_info.first_speech_start - additional_info.expected_subtitle_start` SHALL equal `offset_seconds` within ±0.01

### Requirement: VAD Padding Chunks Configuration

The system SHALL apply `sync.vad.padding_chunks` (default `3`) as the number of non-speech chunks included before and after each detected speech segment when `LocalVadDetector` labels audio via the VAD backend. A change in `padding_chunks` SHALL be passed through to the VAD labeling step without requiring any other configuration change. Implemented in `src/services/vad/detector.rs` (the `vad.label(..., padding_chunks, ...)` call) and defined in `src/config/mod.rs::VadConfig`.

#### Scenario: Configured padding is applied to the VAD backend
- **GIVEN** `sync.vad.padding_chunks = 5` in configuration
- **WHEN** `LocalVadDetector` runs VAD labeling over an audio buffer
- **THEN** it SHALL invoke the underlying VAD label function with the padding-chunks argument equal to `5`

### Requirement: VAD-Independent Manual Offset Application

The manual-offset timing transform SHALL be reachable without constructing a `SyncEngine`, so that a caller who never performs detection is not subject to the engine's VAD precondition.

- The library SHALL expose `shift_subtitle_timing(subtitle: &mut Subtitle, offset_seconds: f32) -> Result<SyncResult>` as a free function in `subx_core::core::sync` (`src/core/sync/mod.rs`), alongside `resolve_sync_pairing` and `create_default_output_path`.
- The function SHALL apply the offset to every entry with the semantics defined by *Subtitle Timing Application* and SHALL return the `SyncResult` defined there.
- The function SHALL NOT read `sync.max_offset_seconds` and SHALL NOT require, construct, or consult a VAD detector, an audio processor, a `SyncConfig`, or a `ConfigService`. Its only inputs are the subtitle and the offset.
- `SyncEngine::apply_manual_offset` SHALL delegate to this function after performing its own guard, so that exactly one implementation of the transform exists. The two entry points SHALL produce identical `SyncResult` field values and identical entry timings for any input the guard admits.
- The function's rustdoc SHALL state that `sync.max_offset_seconds` is not enforced and SHALL name `SyncEngine::apply_manual_offset` as the entry point that enforces it, so a caller choosing between them is told which obligation it is taking on.

#### Scenario: A caller with no VAD available applies a manual offset
- **GIVEN** a host with `sync.vad.enabled = false`, for which `SyncEngine::new` returns a configuration error
- **WHEN** the host calls `shift_subtitle_timing` with a parsed subtitle and an offset
- **THEN** the offset SHALL be applied and a `SyncResult` with `method_used = SyncMethod::Manual` SHALL be returned, with no engine constructed and no VAD detector involved

#### Scenario: The free function does not enforce the configured maximum
- **GIVEN** `sync.max_offset_seconds = 60` in configuration and a call to `shift_subtitle_timing` with an offset of 120 seconds
- **WHEN** the function runs
- **THEN** it SHALL apply the 120-second offset and SHALL NOT return a configuration error, because the guard belongs to `SyncEngine::apply_manual_offset` and the function is documented as unguarded

#### Scenario: The two entry points cannot drift
- **GIVEN** a subtitle and an offset within `sync.max_offset_seconds`
- **WHEN** the same input is passed to `SyncEngine::apply_manual_offset` and to `shift_subtitle_timing`
- **THEN** the resulting entry timings SHALL be identical and the returned `SyncResult`'s `offset_seconds`, `confidence`, `method_used`, `correlation_peak`, `additional_info` and `warnings` SHALL be identical

### Requirement: Core-Owned Sync Pairing Resolution

Deciding whether a `sync` invocation is a single pair or a batch, and auto-pairing a lone video or subtitle with its sibling on disk, SHALL be a documented core API rather than implicit behaviour of an argument-parser struct.

The core module `crate::core::sync` (`src/core/sync/mod.rs`) SHALL expose:

- `pub enum SyncMode { Single { video: PathBuf, subtitle: PathBuf }, Batch(InputPathHandler) }` — the resolved outcome.
- `pub enum BatchRequest { Off, Auto, Directory(PathBuf) }` — a parser-agnostic encoding of the `--batch [DIR]` tri-state, replacing clap's `Option<Option<PathBuf>>`.
- `pub struct SyncPairingRequest` with the fields `positional_paths: Vec<PathBuf>`, `input_paths: Vec<PathBuf>`, `video: Option<PathBuf>`, `subtitle: Option<PathBuf>`, `batch: BatchRequest`, `recursive: bool`, `no_extract: bool`, and `manual: bool`.
- `pub fn resolve_sync_pairing(request: &SyncPairingRequest) -> Result<SyncMode, SubXError>`.
- `pub const SYNC_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS: &[&str]` = `["mp4", "mkv", "avi", "mov"]` and `pub const SYNC_SUBTITLE_EXTENSIONS: &[&str]` = `["srt", "ass", "vtt", "sub"]`, which SHALL be the single definition of those lists for both pairing and handler construction.

`resolve_sync_pairing` SHALL apply the following algorithm, in order:

1. **Batch selection.** If `batch != BatchRequest::Off`, or `input_paths` is non-empty, or any entry of `positional_paths` has no file extension, the result SHALL be `SyncMode::Batch`. The handler's path list SHALL be the batch directory (when `batch == Directory(d)`) followed by `input_paths` followed by `positional_paths`; when that list is empty it SHALL default to `["."]`. The handler SHALL be built with the caller's `recursive` and `no_extract` values and with the union of `SYNC_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS` and `SYNC_SUBTITLE_EXTENSIONS` as its extension filter.
2. **Single positional path.** With exactly one positional path and no batch trigger, the extension SHALL be lower-cased and classified. If it is in `SYNC_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS`, the path becomes the video and the resolver SHALL probe the path's parent directory (or `.` when it has none) for `<stem>.<ext>` over `SYNC_SUBTITLE_EXTENSIONS` **in declaration order**, taking the first entry for which `Path::exists()` is true. If it is in `SYNC_SUBTITLE_EXTENSIONS`, the path becomes the subtitle and the same probe runs over `SYNC_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS`. Any other extension SHALL classify as neither.
3. **Two positional paths.** With exactly two positional paths, each SHALL be classified by its lower-cased extension against the two lists; no filesystem probing occurs.
4. **Explicit options.** Otherwise, `video` and `subtitle` SHALL be used as supplied.
5. **Manual-mode relaxation.** When `manual` is true and a subtitle has been resolved but no video has, the result SHALL be `SyncMode::Single` with an **empty** `PathBuf` as the video, signalling "no video required".
6. **Failure.** When no `SyncMode` can be produced, the call SHALL return `Err(SubXError::InvalidSyncConfiguration)`.

That `SyncArgs::get_sync_mode` becomes a thin adapter translating `Option<Option<PathBuf>>` into `BatchRequest` and `is_manual_mode()` into `manual` with no filesystem access and no pairing logic, and that `crate::cli::SyncMode` remains a legacy re-export without `#[deprecated]`, are `subx-cli` obligations, specified by the `timeline-sync` capability's *Sync Argument Struct Is a Thin Adapter Over Core Pairing* requirement in `subx-cli`.

The batch *pairing* performed afterwards inside `subx-cli:src/commands/sync_command.rs` (the filename-stem prefix heuristic and the single-video/single-subtitle override) is a separate, command-level concern specified by the *Batch Prefix-Match Pairing*, *Batch Skip Directories Without Videos*, and *Batch Single-Pair Override* requirements in `subx-cli`, and is unaffected by this requirement.

#### Scenario: Lone video positional finds its subtitle on disk
- **GIVEN** a directory containing `movie.mp4` and `movie.srt`, and a `SyncPairingRequest` whose only positional path is `movie.mp4`
- **WHEN** `resolve_sync_pairing` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL return `SyncMode::Single { video: movie.mp4, subtitle: movie.srt }`

#### Scenario: Lone subtitle positional finds its video on disk
- **GIVEN** a directory containing `movie.mkv` and `movie.ass`, and a `SyncPairingRequest` whose only positional path is `movie.ass`
- **WHEN** `resolve_sync_pairing` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL return `SyncMode::Single { video: movie.mkv, subtitle: movie.ass }`

#### Scenario: Probe order follows the declared extension lists
- **GIVEN** a directory containing `movie.mp4`, `movie.srt`, and `movie.ass`, and a `SyncPairingRequest` whose only positional path is `movie.mp4`
- **WHEN** `resolve_sync_pairing` runs
- **THEN** the chosen subtitle SHALL be `movie.srt`, because `srt` precedes `ass` in `SYNC_SUBTITLE_EXTENSIONS`

#### Scenario: Manual mode accepts a subtitle with no video
- **GIVEN** a `SyncPairingRequest` with `manual == true` whose only positional path is `movie.srt`, and no `movie.<video-ext>` exists beside it
- **WHEN** `resolve_sync_pairing` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL return `SyncMode::Single` whose `subtitle` is `movie.srt` and whose `video` is an empty `PathBuf`

#### Scenario: Unpairable single positional is rejected
- **GIVEN** a `SyncPairingRequest` with `manual == false` whose only positional path is `movie.mp4`, with no subtitle file beside it
- **WHEN** `resolve_sync_pairing` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL return `Err(SubXError::InvalidSyncConfiguration)`

#### Scenario: Two positional paths are classified without probing
- **GIVEN** a `SyncPairingRequest` whose positional paths are `movie.srt` and `movie.mp4`, in that order
- **WHEN** `resolve_sync_pairing` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL return `SyncMode::Single { video: movie.mp4, subtitle: movie.srt }` without testing any other path for existence

#### Scenario: Each batch trigger selects batch mode
- **GIVEN** three `SyncPairingRequest` values that differ only in their batch trigger — one with `batch == Directory(dir)`, one with a non-empty `input_paths`, and one whose sole positional path has no extension
- **WHEN** `resolve_sync_pairing` runs for each
- **THEN** every call SHALL return `SyncMode::Batch`

#### Scenario: Batch with no usable paths defaults to the current directory
- **GIVEN** a `SyncPairingRequest` with `batch == BatchRequest::Auto`, empty `input_paths`, and empty `positional_paths`
- **WHEN** `resolve_sync_pairing` runs
- **THEN** the returned `SyncMode::Batch` handler's path list SHALL be exactly `["."]`

### Requirement: Core-Owned Default Output Path Derivation

Deriving the default synchronized-output filename SHALL be a core API. `crate::core::sync::create_default_output_path(input: &Path) -> PathBuf` (`src/core/sync/mod.rs`) SHALL return the input path with its file name replaced by `<file_stem>_synced.<extension>`, and SHALL return the input path unchanged when it has no file stem or no extension.

The legacy `crate::cli::sync_args::create_default_output_path` re-export — documented in rustdoc without a `#[deprecated]` attribute — and the rule that `subx-cli`'s in-crate callers (`SyncArgs::get_output_path`, `subx-cli:src/commands/sync_command.rs`) reference the core path instead, are `subx-cli` obligations, specified by the `timeline-sync` capability's *Sync Argument Struct Is a Thin Adapter Over Core Pairing* requirement in `subx-cli`.

#### Scenario: Stem gains the `_synced` suffix
- **GIVEN** the input path `subs/movie.srt`
- **WHEN** `create_default_output_path` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL return `subs/movie_synced.srt`

#### Scenario: Extension is preserved verbatim
- **GIVEN** the input path `subs/movie.vtt`
- **WHEN** `create_default_output_path` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL return `subs/movie_synced.vtt`

#### Scenario: Extensionless input is returned unchanged
- **GIVEN** an input path with a file stem but no extension
- **WHEN** `create_default_output_path` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL return the input path unchanged
